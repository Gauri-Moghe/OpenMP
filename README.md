# OpenMP - Cholesky Decomposition Optimization

This project demonstrates how OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) can significantly accelerate Cholesky Decomposition of large symmetric positive-definite matrices in C++ through multi-threaded parallelization.

---

## 📌 Overview

Cholesky Decomposition is used to factor a symmetric, positive-definite matrix **A** into the product:

```
A = L × Lᵀ
```

Where:
- **L** is a lower triangular matrix
- **Lᵀ** is the transpose of **L**

This repo compares two implementations:
- **Original**: Serial nested loop approach
- **Optimized**: Parallelized using OpenMP (`#pragma omp parallel for`)

| File              | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `original.cpp`    | Serial Cholesky Decomposition |
| `optimized.cpp`   | OpenMP-accelerated Cholesky Decomposition |
| `OpenMP_report.pdf` | Report detailing algorithm and OpenMP optimization strategy |

## 🚀 Performance

The OpenMP version achieved a **~4.76× speedup** over the serial version by parallelizing the outer loop with OpenMP.

---

## 🛠️ Compilation & Execution

### 🔧 Compile Original Version

```bash
g++ -O3 -o original original.cpp
./original
```

### ⚡ Compile OpenMP-Optimized Version

```bash
g++ -fopenmp -O3 -o optimized optimized.cpp
./optimized
```

- `-fopenmp`: Enables OpenMP support
- `-O3`: Enables high-level optimizations

---

## ⚙️ OpenMP Optimizations

- `#include <omp.h>` for multi-threading
- `#pragma omp parallel for` on outer loop
- `omp_set_num_threads(14)` to use 14 threads for maximum parallelism
